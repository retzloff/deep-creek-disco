			A strange colosseum floats in the astral sea. Warriors gather from every plane, with reasons
			to fight as varied as the fighters themselves. Some seek honor, some money, some bloodshed,
			and some simply seek to survive.
		</p>

		<p>
			You are one such warrior and you find yourself on the sands of the arena, your fate in the
			hands of your skill and the crowd…or is it? Who is the strange announcer that goes only by The
			Emperor, what are those strange sounds you sometimes hear behind the walls, why does the
			ground sometimes rumble beneath your feet? The answer to these mysteries and more await you in
			the Colosseum!
